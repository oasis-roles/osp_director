osp_director
===========

Installs OSP Director and runs install of undercloud. This role mimics the steps in the
[OSP 13](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/)
install document from Red Hat. This particular role covers chapters 4 and 6 in
the above document. Some steps are omitted because they are covered
in other roles within OASIS. For example

* 4.1 - Creating the stack user. See the
[users\_and\_groups](https://github.com/oasis-roles/users_and_groups) role
* 4.3 - Setting the undercloud hostname. See the
[hostname](https://github.com/oasis-roles/hostname) role
* 4.4 - Registering and updating your undercloud. See the
[rhsm](https://github.com/oasis-roles/rhsm) role. Also, be sure to run an update
on all the systems before running this role
* 4.7 - Configuring the director. This step is just uploading the templates, which
is the job of [osp\_templates](https://github.com/oasis-roles/osp_templates).
* A.7 Trust overcloud cert from the undercloud. Handling overcloud certificates
is the work of [update\_ca\_trust](https://github.com/oasis-roles/update_ca_trust).


Requirements
------------

Ansible 2.9 or higher

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or equivalent

Valid Red Hat Subscriptions

Role Variables
--------------

Currently the following variables are supported:

### General

* `osp_director_named_env` - Name of the stack environment to create. Defaults
  to "example-dev".
* `osp_director_undercloud` - A dictionary of a few values needed in this role
  to configure things outside of the templates. Takes the structure:
```yaml
osp_director_undercloud:
  stack_user_password: password
  hostname: director.example.com
  cidr: 192.168.10.10/24
  install_ceph_ansible: false
  nameservers:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4
```
* `osp_director_overcloud` - A dictionary with a few values needed outside
  of the templates to run Director. Takes the strcuture:
```yaml
osp_director_overcloud:
  domain: example.com
  ceph: "no"
  overcloud_full_image_root_password: secret123
```
* `osp_director_templates` - Path to the templates that are needed to run
  Director. These are highly dependent on your environment and desired config
  for OpenStack. See the [osp\_templates](https://github.com/oasis-roles/osp_templates)
  role's `sample` directory for one such example. However, that example should
  not be taken as anything close to representative of the breadth of options
  or complexity.
* `osp_director_become` - Default: true. If this role needs administrator
  privileges, then use the Ansible become functionality (based off sudo).
* `osp_director_become_user` - Default: root. If the role uses the become
  functionality for privilege escalation, then this is the name of the target
  user to change to.
